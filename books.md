# You Dont Know JS 13/06/19
https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md
Its a few years old (2015) so some of the "in the future" stuff is the present now, it doesn't teach web development at all, but for going from 0 to being able to understanding code (and kata) written in javascript its awesome, the authors tone's good, he repeats a chunk of book 5 in book 6 and he likes to make up terms by melding words together

# Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager* by Michael Lopp 27/06/19
his style didn't gel with me.
Worst offenders to me were he labels _everyone_ (person A is a Chatty Patty, person B is a Translator Tim), he spent a paragraph explaining without sarcasm how he judges resumes _by their fonts_, and spent and an _entire chapter_ describing how he gets into "the zone" and that coworkers (and loved ones) should rightly expect an aggressive reaction if they interrupt.
Positive messages were if you don't follow up on things you say you'll do you'll erode your credibility, listen carefully to people's concerns especially if they're panicked and babbling and try to treat any change as an opportunity, and it's not overly long
*Half a thumbs up*

# JS for impatient programmers (except the quizzes) (as recommended by @alan) 08/07/19
https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/index.html
A good guide starting from basics to advanced features
Everything it teaches you is presented as unit tests which is reassuring.
It covers a chunk of ES6 in much more detail than YDKJS and includes bits that YDKJS missed out on (like async) but goes into slightly less detail on the (pre ES6) mechanisms behind it.
Most chapters end with a reference guide for whatever feature it was about which no one will ever use as reference because online docs are much better but sometimes as a listing it's useful for finding out about methods you didn't know a type had.
*9 thumbs up*

# Clean Code: Writing Code for Humans* (as recommended by @peterlaw) 10/07/19
https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/writing-clean-code-humans
Covers much of the same ground as Robert C Martin's Clean Code and cites it several times, with a little bit of uncited Pragmatic Programmer thrown in at the end
All the advice is useful (maybe even essential) and should be applied when working on code you expect anyone else to read (including yourself a week from now)
The demo is the weakest part of the course, it's very improvised, I think he should have rehearsed it.
Its 98% language and paradigm agnostic with a 2% swing to object oriented and c#
*8.5 thumbs up*
